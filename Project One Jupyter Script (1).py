# # Project One: Data Visualization, Descriptive Statistics, Confidence Intervals
# 
# 
# You are a data analyst for a basketball team and have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze performance patterns. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you use descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to study distributions of key performance metrics that are included in the data set. These data-driven analytics will help make key decisions to improve the performance of the team. You will use the Python programming language to perform the statistical analyses and then prepare a report of your findings to present for the teamâ€™s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and describe their practical implications. 
# 
# 

# The ELO rating, represented by the variable **elo_n**, is used as a measure of the relative skill of a team. This measure is inferred based on the final score of a game, the game location, and the outcome of the game relative to the probability of that outcome. The higher the number, the higher  the relative skill of a team.
# 
# 
# In addition to studying data on your own team, your management has assigned you a second team so that you can compare its performance with your own team's. 

# ## Step 1: Data Preparation & the Assigned Team

# ## Step 2: Pick Your Team

# In[2]:


# Range of years: 2013-2015 (Note: The line below selects ALL teams within the three-year period 2013-2015. This is not your team's dataframe.
your_years_leagues_df = nba_orig_df[(nba_orig_df['year_id'].between(2013, 2015))]

# The dataframe for your team is called your_team_df.

#  

# ## Step 3: Data Visualization: Points Scored by Your Team
# The coach has requested that you provide a visual that shows the distribution of points scored by your team in the years 2013-2015. 
#
# In[3]:


import seaborn as sns

# Histogram
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.hist(your_team_df['pts'], bins=20)

ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

sns.regplot(your_team_df['year_id'], your_team_df['pts'], ci=None)
plt.show()


#  

# ## Step 4: Data Visualization: Points Scored by the Assigned Team
# The coach has also requested that you provide a visual that shows a distribution of points scored by the Bulls from years 1996-1998. 
# In[4]:


import seaborn as sns

# Histogram

sns.regplot(assigned_team_df['year_id'], assigned_team_df['pts'], ci=None)
plt.show()


#  

# ## Step 5: Data Visualization: Comparing the Two Teams
# Now the coach wants you to prepare one plot that provides a visual of the differences in the distribution of points scored by the assigned team and your team. 
# 
# In[5]:


import seaborn as sns

# Side-by-side boxplots
both_teams_df = pd.concat((assigned_team_df, your_team_df))

plt.show()


#  

# ## Step 6: Descriptive Statistics: Points Scored By Your Time in Home Games
# The management of your team wants you to run descriptive statistics on the points scored by your team in the games played at your team's venue in 2013-2015. Calculate descriptive statistics including the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for points scored by your team played at Home. 

# In[6]:

variance = your_team_home_df['pts'].var()
stdeviation = your_team_home_df['pts'].std()

print('Mean =', round(mean,2))
print('Median =', round(median,2))
print('Variance =', round(variance,2))
print('Standard Deviation =', round(stdeviation,2))


#  

# ## Step 7 - Descriptive Statistics - Points Scored By Your Time in Away Games
# The management also wants you to run descriptive statistics on the points scored by your team in games played at opponent's venue (Away) in 2013-2015. They want you to analyze measures of central tendency (e.g. mean, median) and measures of spread (e.g. standard deviation) in explaining if the team is doing better in Home games compared to Away games. Calculate descriptive statistics including the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for points scored by your team played in opponent's venue (Away).

# ## Step 8: Confidence Intervals for the Average Relative Skill of All Teams in Your Team's Years
# The management wants to you to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average relative skill of all teams in 2013-2015. You will use the variable 'elo_n' to respresent the relative skill of the teams.

# ## Step 9 - Confidence Intervals  for the Average Relative Skill of All Teams in the Assigned Team's Years
# The management also wants to you to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average relative skill of all teams in the years 1996-1998.
# 
# The management also wants you to calculate the probability that a team had a relative skill level less than the Bulls in years 1996-1998.
